    "## 1. Setup and Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "This section establishes the environment required to build an end-to-end machine learning workflow that integrates AWS S3, MLflow, and Python-based data processing. The setup ensures that the notebook is able to retrieve data from cloud storage, perform preprocessing, and track model experiments in a reproducible manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Connecting to AWS S3\n",
    "The raw Airbnb dataset used in this project is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket named \"airbnb-pricing-ml-project-sandhya\". To allow the local development environment to access this bucket, the following steps were completed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An IAM user was created with programmatic access.\n",
    "2. An access key and secret key were generated.\n",
    "3. The AWS CLI was installed locally.\n",
    "4. Credentials were configured using the command \"aws configure\".\n",
    "5. Access to the S3 bucket was verified using the command \"aws s3 ls\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful authentication enables the notebook to communicate with AWS S3 using the boto3 library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Importing Required Libraries\n",
    "The environment imports all required Python libraries for tasks such as data manipulation, visualization, feature engineering, modeling, cloud access, and experiment tracking. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pandas and numpy for data handling\n",
    "- matplotlib and seaborn for exploratory data analysis\n",
    "- scikit-learn for preprocessing and model development\n",
    "- boto3 for interacting with AWS S3\n",
    "- mlflow for tracking experiments and managing models\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing the necessary libraries at the beginning ensures a consistent and organized workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Configuring MLflow Experiment Space\n",
    "A dedicated MLflow experiment name is defined in the notebook. This experiment repository will store:\n",
    "\n",
    "- model parameters\n",
    "- performance metrics\n",
    "- generated artifacts\n",
    "- registered models\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuring MLflow at the beginning ensures that all modeling steps are tracked in a reproducible and organized manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the setup phase prepares the notebook to function as a complete machine learning pipeline with cloud-based data retrieval and experiment management.\n"

    "## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the exploratory data analysis step is to obtain an initial understanding of the Airbnb dataset, identify potential data issues, and determine the preprocessing actions required before model development. This step provides insights about missing values, outliers, distributions, and the nature of both numerical and categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Dataset Overview\n",
    "Using data summary functions, the dataset was examined to understand its structure. The dataset contains 48,895 rows and 16 columns, representing Airbnb listings in New York City. The columns include identification fields, host information, location coordinates, room attributes, price, and review-related fields. The data types include numerical values, categorical values, and date fields stored as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Missing Values\n",
    "A review of missing data indicated that several columns contain null values. The missing value distribution is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"name\" contains 16 missing entries\n",
    "- \"host_name\" contains 21 missing entries\n",
    "- \"last_review\" contains approximately 10,000 missing entries\n",
    "- \"reviews_per_month\" contains approximately 10,000 missing entries\n",
    "\n",
    "The missing values in the review columns are expected because many listings have never received a review. Understanding this missingness is important for selecting suitable imputation strategies in later steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Statistical Summary\n",
    "A descriptive statistical summary was generated to identify typical ranges and distributions of numerical variables. Key observations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The price variable shows a heavily skewed distribution with several extreme outliers. While most listings fall within a reasonable price range, a small number of listings have values exceeding 10,000.\n",
    "- The minimum_nights variable also exhibits extreme values, including listings with unrealistic minimum stays of several hundred days.\n",
    "- Other variables such as number_of_reviews, availability_365, latitude, and longitude fall within expected ranges but still require preprocessing before modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary highlights the presence of outliers that may affect model stability and must be handled during data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Categorical Features\n",
    "The dataset includes important categorical variables such as \"neighbourhood_group\", \"neighbourhood\", and \"room_type\". These variables contain no missing values and are cleanly formatted. They will be transformed into numerical representations using encoding techniques during the modeling stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Review Activity and Date Fields\n",
    "The \"last_review\" column contains dates stored as strings, and many entries are missing. Before the date can be used meaningfully, it must be converted to a datetime format.

    "The EDA process revealed several important aspects of the dataset. The data contains missing values in review-related fields, extreme outliers in price and minimum_nights, and textual date formats requiring conversion. Categorical variables are well structured and ready for encoding. These observations guide the data cleaning strategy described in the next step.\n"

    "## 3. Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the data cleaning stage is to prepare the dataset for effective feature engineering and model development. The raw dataset contains missing values, extreme outliers, non-numeric date fields, and several columns that are not useful for predicting listing prices. This step ensures that all variables are in a clean, consistent, and model-ready format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Removal of Non-Predictive Columns\n",
    "Four columns were removed from the dataset: \"id\", \"host_id\", \"name\", and \"host_name\". These fields represent identifiers or descriptive text that do not contribute to numerical price prediction. Removing such variables simplifies the dataset and prevents irrelevant information from entering the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Processing Review-Related Fields\n",
    "The \"last_review\" column was originally stored as a string and contained many missing values for listings with no reviews. This column was converted into a datetime format to make it suitable for feature extraction. Missing values were filled with a placeholder date (\"2000-01-01\") to ensure that the column contains valid datetime entries for all rows. The \"reviews_per_month\" column also contained missing values, which were replaced with zero, because missing values in this context indicate that the listing has never received a review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Handling Outliers in Numerical Fields\n",
    "Two numerical fields contained extreme values that could negatively affect model performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"price\" column included values above 10,000, representing unrealistic or extremely uncommon prices. Since these large values can distort model training, the price variable was clipped to fall within the range of 10 to 1000.\n",
    "- The \"minimum_nights\" column included unusually large values, such as listings requiring hundreds of minimum nights. To prevent these outliers from influencing the model, the values were capped at 30 nights.\n",
    "\n",
    "These adjustments reduce the influence of abnormal entries and create a more stable distribution for predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Feature Engineering\n",
    "A new derived feature called \"last_review_year\" was created by extracting the year from the \"last_review\" datetime column. This feature captures how recent a listing's most recent review is, which can influence demand and therefore pricing. By converting date information into a numerical year value, the model can more easily interpret and utilize this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Final Structure After Cleaning\n",
    "After completing all cleaning steps, the dataset contains 13 well-structured columns with no missing values. All variables are now in appropriate formats, and outliers have been handled. The dataset is prepared for the next step, which involves feature encoding and data splitting for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cleaned version of the dataset forms a reliable foundation for building a predictive machine learning model.\n",

    "## 4. Feature Engineering and Train-Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "This step prepares the cleaned dataset for modeling by selecting the final set of features, separating the target variable, defining categorical and numerical variables, creating a preprocessing pipeline, and splitting the data into training and testing subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Preparing the Modeling Dataset\n",
    "The cleaned dataset was copied into a new dataframe to ensure that the modeling process operates on a stable version of the data. The original \"last_review\" column was removed at this stage because its raw date format is no longer needed. The relevant information from this column has already been captured through the engineered \"last_review_year\" feature. The resulting modeling dataframe contains 12 well-structured columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Separating Features and Target Variable\n",
    "The target variable for this prediction task is \"price\". All remaining columns serve as input features. The dataset was split into two components:\n",
    "- X: the feature set containing 11 explanatory variables\n",
    "- y: the target vector containing listing prices\n",
    "\n",
    "This step ensures a clear separation between inputs and the value being predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Train-Test Split\n",
    "The dataset was split into training and testing subsets using an 80 to 20 ratio, with a fixed random state to ensure reproducibility. The training set contains 39,116 rows and the test set contains 9,779 rows. This proportion provides a sufficiently large sample for model training while preserving a representative subset for evaluating model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Identifying Categorical and Numerical Features\n",
    "The feature space includes both categorical and numerical variables. Proper identification of these types is necessary to apply appropriate preprocessing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical features:\n",
    "- neighbourhood_group\n",
    "- neighbourhood\n",
    "- room_type\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical features:\n",
    "- latitude\n",
    "- longitude\n",
    "- minimum_nights\n",
    "- number_of_reviews\n",
    "- reviews_per_month\n",
    "- calculated_host_listings_count\n",
    "- availability_365\n",
    "- last_review_year\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation enables targeted transformations such as encoding of categorical data and scaling of numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Creating the Preprocessing Pipeline\n",
    "A ColumnTransformer was created to apply preprocessing steps to the dataset in a structured manner. The preprocessing pipeline consists of:\n",
    "- Standard scaling for numerical variables to normalize value ranges\n",
    "- One-hot encoding for categorical variables, with unknown categories handled safely\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessing configuration will be integrated into each machine learning model through a combined pipeline. Using a unified pipeline ensures that the same transformations are consistently applied during training, testing, and later when models are logged in MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this step completes the preparation of the dataset for model development by structuring the feature space, ensuring reproducibility, and establishing a standardized preprocessing workflow.\n"

    "## 5A. Initial Model Development Without MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage focuses on developing baseline machine learning models using the prepared training and testing datasets. The objective is to evaluate multiple regression algorithms and identify their performance characteristics before introducing MLflow tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5A.1 Building Model Pipelines\n",
    "Each regression model was integrated into a scikit-learn Pipeline together with the preprocessing transformer defined earlier. This ensures that the same data transformations, including scaling of numerical features and one-hot encoding of categorical features, are consistently applied during both training and prediction. The models included the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression\n",
    "- Ridge Regression\n",
    "- Lasso Regression\n",
    "- Random Forest Regressor\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting Regressor\n",
    "\n",
    "Using pipelines provides a clean and reliable way to bundle preprocessing with model training and eliminates the risk of inconsistent transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5A.2 Model Training\n",
    "Each pipeline was fitted on the training subset created earlier. This means that every model received the same cleaned and preprocessed input data, enabling a fair comparison between different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5A.3 Model Evaluation\n",
    "A custom evaluation function was used to calculate three key regression metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "- Coefficient of Determination (R²)\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics were computed using predictions generated on the test dataset. The results showed the following trends:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression produced similar performance, with R² values around 0.346.\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting Regressor demonstrated moderate improvement over linear models.\n",
    "- Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance among all models tested, with the lowest MAE and RMSE and the highest R² value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5A.4 Interpretation of Results\n",
    "The performance of the models reflects expectations for this dataset. Linear models capture only basic linear relationships and therefore achieved modest accuracy. Ensemble-based methods, particularly Random Forest, leveraged non-linear interactions and provided significantly better predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These baseline results establish a clear benchmark that will be used for comparison once the models are fully integrated with MLflow tracking in the next step.\n"

    "## 5B. Experiment Tracking with MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "After establishing baseline models, the next step is to make the training and evaluation process fully traceable and reproducible using MLflow. In this section, each regression model is executed within an MLflow run so that parameters, metrics, and model artifacts are recorded centrally and can be compared through the MLflow UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5B.1 MLflow Experiment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "An MLflow experiment named \"airbnb_price_prediction\" was configured at the start of the notebook. All subsequent runs for the different models are associated with this experiment. For each model, a separate MLflow run is created using a context manager. This ensures that the information logged during training is cleanly grouped by model type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5B.2 Logging Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside each MLflow run, basic information about the model is logged:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model name, such as \"LinearRegression\", \"Ridge\", \"Lasso\", \"RandomForest\", and \"GradientBoosting\"\n",
    "- The underlying model type (for example, RandomForestRegressor or GradientBoostingRegressor)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, relevant hyperparameters are logged where applicable, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The regularization strength \"alpha\" for Ridge and Lasso\n",
    "- The number of trees, maximum depth, and random state for Random Forest\n",
    "- The number of estimators, learning rate, and random state for Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging parameters in this way makes it possible to trace how different settings influence performance and to reproduce a specific configuration later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5B.3 Logging Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For each trained pipeline, the model is evaluated on the held-out test set. The following evaluation metrics are logged to MLflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "- Coefficient of Determination (R²)\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric values recorded in MLflow are consistent with the results obtained in the earlier, non-MLflow evaluation step. Random Forest continues to show the best performance, followed by Gradient Boosting, with linear models performing similarly to one another. With MLflow, these metrics can be viewed side by side across all runs to support model comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5B.4 Logging Model Artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire scikit-learn pipeline, which includes both the preprocessing steps and the regression model, is logged as a model artifact in each MLflow run. This makes it possible to reload and use the exact same preprocessing and model configuration directly from MLflow without having to manually reconstruct the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model artifacts are stored along with the run identifier (run_id). A list of runs is maintained in the notebook containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- model_name\n",
    "- run_id\n",
    "- MAE\n",
    "- RMSE\n",
    "- R²\n",
    "\n",
    "This table provides a concise summary in the notebook and links each set of metrics back to the corresponding MLflow run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5B.5 Benefits of MLflow Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating MLflow into the modeling workflow, the project gains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A structured history of all model training experiments\n",
    "- Clear visibility into which model and hyperparameter configuration performed best\n",
    "- The ability to inspect and compare runs through the MLflow UI\n",
    "- A reusable and shareable record of trained models, including their preprocessing logic\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes the experiment tracking component of the assignment and prepares the groundwork for selecting and registering the best-performing model in the next step.\n"

    "## 5C. Model Performance Visualization and Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we visualize and compare the performance of all models trained in Steps 5A and 5B using three key regression metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices.  \n",
    "- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** – penalizes larger errors more strongly.  \n",
    "- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)** – proportion of variance in the target explained by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5C.1 Summary of Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the evaluation metrics logged in MLflow, we obtain the following summary for our five models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Regression**  \n",
    "  - MAE ≈ **58.08**  \n",
    "  - RMSE ≈ **103.33**  \n",
    "  - R² ≈ **0.346**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression**  \n",
    "  - MAE ≈ **58.03**  \n",
    "  - RMSE ≈ **103.23**  \n",
    "  - R² ≈ **0.347**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lasso Regression**  \n",
    "  - MAE ≈ **58.07**  \n",
    "  - RMSE ≈ **103.31**  \n",
    "  - R² ≈ **0.346**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Forest Regressor**  \n",
    "  - MAE ≈ **51.66**  \n",
    "  - RMSE ≈ **97.28**  \n",
    "  - R² ≈ **0.420**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**  \n",
    "  - MAE ≈ **53.68**  \n",
    "  - RMSE ≈ **99.69**  \n",
    "  - R² ≈ **0.391**\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are consistent with the metrics shown in the MLflow UI for the experiment\n",
    "`airbnb_price_prediction`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5C.2 Visual Comparison of Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the comparison easier, we create bar plots for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MAE vs. Model**\n",
    "- **RMSE vs. Model**\n",
    "- **R² vs. Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "These plots allow us to quickly see:\n",
    "\n",
    "- which models have **lower error** (MAE, RMSE), and  \n",
    "- which models explain **more variance** in Airbnb prices (higher R²).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5C.3 Observations and Best Model\n",
    "\n",
    "From both the numeric summary and the visualizations, we can observe that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The three **linear-family models** (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso) give **very similar performance**.  \n",
    "- **Gradient Boosting** improves on the linear models, but its error is still slightly higher than Random Forest.  \n",
    "- **Random Forest Regressor** achieves:\n",
    "  - the **lowest MAE**  \n",
    "  - the **lowest RMSE**  \n",
    "  - the **highest R²** (~0.42)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, Random Forest is selected as the best-performing model** for this project based on the current feature set and train–test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step, we will use this best model for further analysis and discussion (e.g., feature importance, limitations, and possible future improvements).\n"
